                            audience and be useful to them. In order to achieve that, it is necessary to befriend
                            Google&apos;s mechanisms and algorithms. There is no use of a pretty website, if it&apos;s
                            displayed on a 10th page of search results, because this way no one will ever find it. That
                            brings us to the topic of Google&apos;s Website Ranking.Generally speaking, it&apos;s a list
                            of pages and their keywords, sorted in the order of search results. The higher your place in
                            the ranking is, the more people are likely to see your page.</p>

                                hearable — are high-tech in-ear devices that do more than transmit audio. These
                                headphones are usually wireless, and they can sync up with your phone, tablet, computer
                                or other Bluetooth-enabled device. The main appeal of hearables is convenience, as they
                                allow you to complete common tasks without directly accessing your phone or computer.
                                Smart wireless headphones sync up to other devices using Bluetooth technology, and many
                                of their features rely on data from your smartphone or computer.</p>
